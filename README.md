# Comprehensive Analysis of Furniture Store’s Sales Performance
## Project Summary

A furniture store in the U.S. wants to analyze the data associated with their sales between 2014 and 2017. The store needs to make business decisions based on sales data from previous years. They want a preliminary analysis of sales, sales volume, profit and products.

## Project Scope

The objective of this sales report is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the furniture store’s sales performance, aiming to discern prevailing market trends while pinpointing specific areas encountering challenges that demand concentrated attention and strategic interventions. Concurrently, the report aims to highlight the store's thriving segments and further analyze the factors contributing to their success.

## Recommendations - Next Steps
- It's important to identify the specific factors contributing to profit fluctuations and devise strategies to mitigate them in the future.
- Analyze in detail `January`, `February`, `May` and especially `October` from 2017. Each of these months presents a unique opportunity for deeper analysis to uncover the underlying factors contributing to the negative profit outcomes. Whether it be seasonal fluctuations in demand, unexpected cost escalations, or operational inefficiencies, understanding the root causes behind these downturns is crucial for implementing targeted interventions to mitigate similar challenges in the future.
- When it comes to the states that consistently exhibit negative profits (`Texas`, `Illinois` and `Pennsylvania`) it's imperative to study each of them in detail. Once the root issues are identified, it will be possible to design a plan and make an informed decision for the stores in those states.
- It's worthwhile to examine the bottom-performing products in the `Table` category since all of them are among the bottom ten performers in terms of profitability. The most profitable product in the category yields $331.72.
- There are products with $-1204.76 in loss indicating difficulties in this product's market viability.
- With these insights, we can implement targeted initiatives to optimize profitability while sustaining sales momentum, fostering a more resilient and financially robust business model.
